# Fire-detecting-tool-IOT-project
The cities in Bangladesh have several strains. Among various strains in the city areas of Bangladesh, traffic prone &amp; insecure transport systems, non-fire-resistant infrastructure etc. are the major problems. Therefore, to gain a viable city, an integrated smart city along with a Fire-resistant infrastructure project is approached, focusing on removing the barriers to the wellbeing of the community. Our aim is to build an integrated tool, named Fire Alert &amp; Detection Tool (FADT) , which will collect analogue data from specific areas and respond via buzzer, SMS, and red light to protect any individual from fire accidents. The objective is to make infrastructures (indoors) fire-resistant and to develop a real-time alert system and the stakeholders are individual tool owners &amp; fire service centers. â€‹
